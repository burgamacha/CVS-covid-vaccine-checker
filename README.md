<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The CVS Vaccine Checker

This script checks for covid-19 vaccines near you. 

## Installation
1. Install Python. 
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the required
packages (`requests` and `beepy`). 
3. If you use [conda](https://conda.io), run `conda env create -f environment.yaml` and then activate the conda environment using `conda activate vacdev` before running the script.

This should be easy enough for someone comfortable with technology. Ask for help on NextDoor or Reddit - it's where I answer a lot of tech questions for my neighbors!

## Usage

Run the script with your chosen state and list of cities. For example, to search for appointments in NJ in the cities of Princeton and Plainsboro, run

```bash
python vaccine.py --state NJ --cities princeton plainsboro "Belle Mead"
```

You will see output like this:

```
Tue Mar 30 12:43:37 2021
BELLE MEAD Fully Booked
PLAINSBORO Fully Booked
PRINCETON Fully Booked
```

Alternatively, you can put the cities in a text file, one per line, and use:
```bash
python vaccine.py --state NJ --cityfile cities.txt
```

To find the list of cities, select your state at [CVS immunizations](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine).

By default, the script will check for appointments every minute and run for a total of 3 hours after which it will exit. To change these values, you can use specify `--total` and `--refresh` options respectively. Run `python vaccine.py --help` for details.

This script is for monitoring the appointment website without clicking refresh 1 Billion times. It is not going to automatically book for you. And if you fork this and create an automated booking applet, I will personally send 1000 adolscent, chewing puppies to your house. And nobody wants that. Speaking of contributing...
